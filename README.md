Work Day Scheduler

In this week's challenge, I was tasked with creating a planner that allows a user to:
    -Add text to time blocks
    -Save these to local storage
    -Keep them on the page after refreshing
    -View availability for slots through the use of colours and real-time

This week I was provided with a starter code to develop on, which required me to implement skills from last week's lessons. 

Once the deployed application runs, the user is greeted with a welcome message, a simple description for the site, and a live view of the current date, day, and time. Additionally, users can see the time slots on the left ranging from 9AM - 5PM, the time blocks that change colour to indicate availability, and their personal inputs that remain on the page despite refreshing.
