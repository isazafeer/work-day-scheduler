**Work Day Scheduler**

In this week's challenge, I was tasked with creating a planner that allows a user to:

    -Add text to time blocks
    
    -Save these to local storage
    
    -Keep them on the page after refreshing
    
    -View availability for slots through the use of colours and real-time

This week I was provided with a starter code to develop on, which required me to implement skills from last week's lessons. 

Once the deployed application runs, the user is greeted with a welcome message, a simple description for the site, and a live view of the current date, day, and time. Additionally, users can see the time slots on the left ranging from 9AM - 5PM, the time blocks that change colour to indicate availability, and their personal inputs that remain on the page despite refreshing. 


The image below shows that the local storage feature is operational.

Here is the final form of the challenge after several more adjustments and CSS edits.
